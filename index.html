        <h2>
          Picking a random choice could be really stressful, tasking and time
          consuming so we decided to help you with that.
        </h2>
        <p>
          The choice could be as simple as a choice between eating bread or rice
          or as difficult as choosing whether or not to post a picture.
        </p>
        <i>
          P.S You can only have 2 choices at least and 5 choices at most. Make
          your input as short as possible.
