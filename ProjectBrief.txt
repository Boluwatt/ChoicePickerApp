Project Name: Choice Picker App
Author: Oluwagbamila Boluwatife

Project Description
    The choice picker app was borne out of the need to make a choice between two options without
    my personal bias getting in the way. This project however will allow users input multiple 
    choices and have a choice picked for them randomly. This totally eliminates natural personal 
    bias as this program will be based purely on Algorithm
